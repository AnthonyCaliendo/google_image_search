# Project 2 - Google Image Search

Google Image Search is an android app that allows a user to search for images on web using simple filters. The app utilizes [Google Image Search API](https://developers.google.com/image-search/). Please note that API has been officially deprecated as of May 26, 2011.

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **search for images** by specifying a query and launching a search. Search displays a grid of image results from the Google Image API.
* [x] User can click on "settings" which allows selection of **advanced search options** to filter results
* [x] User can configure advanced search filters such as:
  * [x] Size (small, medium, large, extra-large)
  * [x] Color filter (black, blue, brown, gray, green, etc...)
  * [x] Type (faces, photo, clip art, line art)
  * [x] Site (espn.com)
* [x] Subsequent searches have any filters applied to the search results
* [x] User can tap on any image in results to see the image **full-screen**
* [x] User can **scroll down to see more images**. The maximum number of images is 64 (limited by API).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Implements robust error handling, [check if internet is available](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Sending-and-Managing-Network-Requests#checking-for-network-connectivity), handle error cases, network failures
* [x] Used the **ActionBar SearchView** or custom layout as the query box instead of an EditText
* [x] User can **share an image** to their friends or email it to themselves
* [x] Replaced Filter Settings Activity with a lightweight modal overlay
* [x] Improved the user interface and experiment with image assets and/or styling and coloring

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

* [x] Used the [StaggeredGridView](https://github.com/f-barth/AndroidStaggeredGrid) to display improve the grid of image results
* [x] User can [zoom or pan images](https://github.com/MikeOrtiz/TouchImageView) displayed in full-screen detail view

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] displays progress spinner when loading search results, including on infinite scroll
* [x] checks network state ahead of time and displays user friendly message
* [x] displays dialog notification on network error
* [x] uses placeholder images for errors and non-loading
* [x] shows instructions for how to use the app, and then hides it when the user searches
* [x] hides the status and action bar when zooming on the image (i.e. goes full screen)

## Notes

I played around with hiding the status and action bar on zoom, but the status bar wouldn't hide properly so I aborted that effort.
